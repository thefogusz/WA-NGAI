# WANGAI

Browser-first MVP for real-time English/Thai communication while playing online games.

## Product promise

Open one secure link, grant microphone/system-audio permission, then use a clean floating widget:

- Other people: English speech -> English transcript + Thai translation.
- You: press the microphone button -> Thai speech -> English text -> Copy.
- End users never provide or see an API key.
- No injection, game hooks, memory reading, automatic typing, or anti-cheat bypass behavior.

## Honest product boundary

The no-install version is feasible on Windows Chrome/Edge using Document Picture-in-Picture as an always-on-top HTML window. It is not equivalent to a native overlay:

- Screen/system-audio permission must be granted again for every capture session.
- A browser-only app cannot provide a reliable global push-to-talk hotkey while the game owns keyboard focus.
- It cannot type directly into another application. MVP uses a visible Copy action and manual paste.
- Exclusive fullscreen and every game's anti-cheat policy are not guaranteed. Target borderless-windowed mode first.

These limits are validation gates, not hidden future problems.

## Current status

The local MVP is implemented in `apps/web`: permission-gated game-audio and microphone capture, PCM16 streaming speech-to-text, final-utterance translation, right-aligned reply bubbles with explicit Copy, push-to-talk, and a 360 × 220 Document Picture-in-Picture widget.

The local API boundary is implemented in `apps/api`. It reads `XAI_API_KEY` only from the ignored root `.env.local` file, exposes a local-only `POST /v1/translate` proxy, and bridges local `/v1/stt` WebSocket streams to xAI. It is not a public deployment and does not yet have user authentication, rate limits, or a public hosting layer.

## Run locally

1. In `apps/api`, run `npm run dev`.
2. In `apps/web`, run `npm run dev`.
3. Open the Vite URL. Development requests under `/v1` proxy to the local API on port 8787.

## Remaining owner validation

Run the manual browser matrix with a real Chrome/Edge tab-audio and microphone permission grant. The local xAI bridge and translation call are connected, but physical audio quality must be checked with the owner’s actual devices and game/Discord setup.
